# crystal_run_shoes_patch
Adds run shoes to crystal and also removes text from the beginning of the game to make Gen 2 Kaizo runs more tolerable.

Hold down b to run, just like in gen 3+!

***THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PSEUDOFLUCTUATING CURVE PATCH! YOU WILL HAVE TO APPLY THAT SEPERATELY IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT!**
